			<dl>
				<dt>Drive wheel type</dt>
					<dd>There are four different drive wheel types to choose from: front wheel drive (FWD),
						rear wheel drive (RWD), all-wheel-drive (AWD) and four wheel drive (4WD). The following table provides a
						description and lists the pros and cons of each drive wheel type.		  
					</dd>
			</dl>
					<table>
					<caption> Comparison of drive wheel types</caption>
						<tr>
							<th id="none">Hidden</th>
							<th>Description</th>
							<th>Pros</th>
							<th>Cons</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th id="wr">Front wheel drive (FWD)</th>
							<td> In a FWD drive vehicle, the two front wheels "push" the vehicle
								while the back two wheels just "ride" along. </td>
							<td>Fuel efficient, low-cost, great traction during inclement weather</td>
							<td>Not high performance, quite fragile</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<th>Rear wheel drive (RWD)</th>
							<td>In a RWD drive vehicle, the back two wheels "drive" the vehicle and also attempt to evenly distribute
								the weight of the car from back to front.</td>
							<td>Durable, easy handling, fast performance</td>
							<td>Poor traction</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<th>All wheel drive (AWD)</th>
							<td> In an AWD vehicle, all wheels receive various amounts of power all the time. This 
							allows the vehicle to remain stable and extra power can be supplied to either set of wheels (front or rear) if needed.</td>
							<td>Excellent traction, Good for mild inclement weather, Able to adapt with changes in terrain</td>
							<td> More expensive than FWD and RWD, Maintenace costs are high, Heavy (less fuel-efficient)</td>		
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<th>Four wheel drive (4WD)</th>
							<td>In a 4WD vehicle, all wheels receive equal amounts of power, and most 4WD vechicles allow you to 
								switch between two wheel drive (FWD and RWD) and four wheel drive.</td>
							<td>Provides the best traction for a vehicle, more fuel-efficient than AWD systems</td>
							<td>Adds much weight to vehicle, More expensive than RWD and FWD.</td>

				<dt>Fuel type</dt>
					<dd>The two most common fuel types are gasoline (petrol) and diesel. Gasoline is used in many consumer vehicles;
					whereas, diesel is primarily used for buses, trains, and trucks. Although, some car manufacturers have started
					using diesel fuel for their cars, for example the 2016 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Sedan. Also, alternative fuels, such
					as ethanol and electricty, are gaining popularity. <br>

					title="Link to Cleantechnica-Alternative Fuels">For more information on
					alternative fuels please click here</a></dd>
				<dt>Number of Cylinders</dt>
					<dd> Cylinders are the fundamental parts of an engine. Most cars have either 4 (inline 4 or flat 4), 6 (V6), or 8 (V8) cylinders.
						Generally, cars with more cylinders are able to handle heavier loads and have better performance than cars
						with fewer cylinders.</dd>
				<dt>Mileage</dt>
					<dd> Mileage is not a problem if you are purchasing a new vehicle, but if you decide to purchase a used vehicle,
					you need to take into consideration mileage. Mileage is usually related to the the car's age. If possible,
					try to purchase a car with less than 110,000 miles and fewer than 10 years old because older cars can require much
					maintenance.</dd>
				<dt>Miles per gallon (MPG)</dt>
					<dd>The miles per gallon (mpg) provides an estimate of the number of miles a vehicle can travel on one gallon of
					fuel. MPG has two listings: city and highway. The city rating is usually lower than the highway listing since more fuel
					is consumed while driving in the city due to frequent stops; whereas, less fuel is consumed while driving on the highway since
					the vehicle travels at a constant speed.</dd>
				<dt>Price</dt>
					<dd>Perhaps the most important thing to consider when purchasing a car is price. The price of a car is dependent 
					on many things such as the type/size of car (luxury, sedan, etc.), additional features, and the age of the vehicle.</dd>
				<dt>Running costs</dt>
					<dd>Commonly overlooked by many car buyers, running costs should be taken into consideration before purchasing a car.
						Running costs include depreciation, registration, insurance, fuel, taxes, and maintenance.

				<dt>Safety features</dt>
					<dd>Cars are required to implement some safety features; while other car manufacturers often 
					implement additional features in order to prove that their vehicles are the safest. Standard safety features
					include airbags, seatbelts, and antilock brakes. Some newer features include blind-spot warning, pedestrian detection,
					and automatic emergency braking.
					<a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2012/04/guide-to-safety-features/index.htm" 
					title="Link to Consumer Reports-Safety Features">Click here for more information on safety features</a></dd>
				<dt>Transmission Types</dt>
					<dd>There are four types of transmissions in cars: manual, automatic, semi-automatic, and
					continuously variable transmission (CVT). In the manual transmission, gears are changed by utilizing the gear shift and
					clutch pedal. The automatic transmission changes gears without the interaction of a human (usually done by the vehicle's
					computer). Semi-automatic transmissions utilize a gear shift, also known as simple shifter or paddles, to change gears
					but do not require a clutch pedal. In CVT transmissions, gears are not used to change speeds; instead, rubber or metal belts
					control the changing of speeds.</dd>
